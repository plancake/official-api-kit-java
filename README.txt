*** PLANCAKE JAVA API KIT *** 

You may be interested in this library if you want to develop a client application written in Java that will use your Plancake data stored in the Cloud.

This is a library that allows you to use the Plancake API without worrying about low-level details, such as REST communication, JSON handling.

With this library your custom client application will be able to interact with the Plancake data stored in the cloud as if the data was stored locally.

In order to use this, you need to get an API key here:
http://www.plancake.com/api-documentation


To get started, have a look at the Example.java file and explore the public methods of the PlancakeApiClient class. 
The package consists of a set of classes (belonging to the com.plancake.api.client and org.json.simple</span> packages) 
and an example program that you can run by launching:
java Example

You can recompile the example program by launching:
javac Example.java
